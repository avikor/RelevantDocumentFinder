## RelevantDocumentFinder
This repository contains a thread safe corpus class for inserting, deleting, and updating documents. <br>It uses term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (tf-idf) score to return the n most relevant documents for a given query.<br>For some toy examples look at 'RelevantDocumentFinder/CorpusTests.cpp'.<br>NOTE #1: I'm not sure it's working as intended. <br>NOTE #2: 'init_docs.txt' should be placed at the same directory as 'RelevantDocumentFinder.exe'.
